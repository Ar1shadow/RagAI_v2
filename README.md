# Local RagAI
This projet is a pratical work combining Microsoft Semantic Kernel, Kernel Memory and Ollama.

Although the functions of SK and KM are rather mature, but not easy for a user to use.Most important, the quality of Rag doesn't satisfying, for me at least.

So, after rewriting some of the handlers and add some new functions, like command menu, personal configuration and better interface, it looks like console app to some extends.

Also, i've made some progress in pipelines of RAG, i employ python in order to use better chunking strategy and OCR while importing the documents
